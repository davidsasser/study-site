This was eloquently voiced in Tagore’s later poems and his last testament, Crisis in Civilisation.  The Indian intelligentsia was in a state of moral dilemma. On the one hand, it could not help  sympathising with England’s dogged courage in the hour of peril, with the Russians fighting  with their backs to the wall against the ruthless Nazi hordes, and with China groaning under the  heel of Japanese militarism; on the other hand, their own country was practically under military  occupation of their own soil, and an Indian army under Subhas Bose was trying from the  opposite camp to liberate their country. No creative impulse could issue from such confusion of  loyalties. One would imagine that the achievement of Indian independence in 1947, which came  in the wake of the Allies’ victory and was followed by the collapse of colonialism in the  neighbouring countries of South-East Asia, would have released an upsurge of creative energy.  No doubt it did, but unfortunately it was soon submerged in the great agony of partition, with its  inhuman slaughter of the innocents and the uprooting of millions of people from their homeland,  followed by the martyrdom of Mahatma Gandhi. These tragedies, along with Pakistan’s  invasion of Kashmir and its later atrocities in Bangladesh, did indeed provoke a poignant  writing, particularly in the languages of the regions most affected, Bengali, Hindi, Kashmiri,  Punjabi, Sindhi and Urdu. But poignant or passionate writing does not by itself make great  literature. What reserves of enthusiasm and confidence survived these disasters have been  mainly absorbed in the task of national reconstruction and economic development. Great  literature has always emerged out of chains of convulsions. Indian literature is richer today in  volume, range and variety than it ever was in the past.
