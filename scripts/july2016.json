Machinery, automobiles, televisions, radios). Then labour-based  advantages shifted to South Korea, then to Malaysia, Mexico and other nations. Today, China  appears to be capitalizing best on the basis of labour. Japanese firms still remain competitive in  markets for such durable goods, electronics and other products, but the labour force is no longer  sufficient for competitive advantage over manufacturers in other industrializing nations. Such  shifting of labour-based advantage is clearly not limited to manufacturing industries. Today, a huge  number of IT and service jobs are moving from Europe and North America to India, Singapore, and  like countries with relatively well-educated, low-cost workforces possessing technical skills. However, as educational levels and technical skills continue to rise in other countries, India,  Singapore, and like nations enjoying labour-based competitive advantage today are likely to find  such advantage cannot be sustained through emergence of new competitors.  In terms of capital, for centuries the days of gold coins and later even paper money restricted  financial flows. Subsequently regional concentrations were formed where large banks, industries  and markets coalesced. But today capital flows internationally at rapid speed. Global commerce no  longer requires regional interactions among business players. Regional capital concentrations in  places such as New York, London and Tokyo still persist, of course, but the capital concentrated there is no longer sufficient for competitive advantage over other capitalists distributed worldwide.  Only if an organization is able to combine, integrate and apply its resources (eg. Land, labour,  capital, IT) in an effective manner that is not readily imitable by competitors can such an  organization enjoy competitive advantage sustainable overtime.  In a knowledge-based theory of the firm, this idea is extended to view organizational knowledge as  a resource with atleast the same level of power and importance as the traditional economic inputs.  An organization with superior knowledge can achieve competitive advantage in markets that  appreciate the application of such knowledge. Semiconductors, genetic engineering,  pharmaceuticals, software, military warfare, and like knowledge-intensive competitive arenas provide both time-proven and current examples. Consider semiconductors (e.g. computer chips),  which are made principally of sand and common metals. These ubiquitous and powerful electronic devices are designed within common office buildings, using commercially available tools, and  fabricated within factories in many industrialized nations.
