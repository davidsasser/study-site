Climate change is considered to be one of the most serious threats to sustainable development,  with adverse impacts on the environment, human health, food security, economic activity, natural  resources and physical infrastructure. Global climate varies naturally. According to the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the effects of climate change have already been  observed, and scientific findings indicate that precautionary and prompt action is necessary.  Vulnerability to climate change is not just a function of geography or dependence on natural  resources; it also has social, economic and political dimensions which influence how climate change  affects different groups. Poor people rarely have insurance to cover loss of property due to natural  calamities i.e. drought, floods, super cyclones etc. The poor communities are already struggling to  cope with the existing challenges of poverty and climate variability and climate change could push  many beyond their ability to cope or even survive. It is vital that these communities are helped to  adapt to the changing dynamics of nature. Adaptation is a process through which societies make  themselves better able to cope with an uncertain future. Adapting to climate change entails taking  the right measures to reduce the negative effects of climate change (or exploit the positive ones) by  making the appropriate adjustments and changes. These range from technological options such  as increased sea defences or flood - proof houses on stilts to behavioural change at the individual  level, such as reducing water use in times of drought. Other strategies include early warning  systems for extreme events, better water management, improved risk management, various  insurance options and biodiversity conservation.      Because of the speed at which climate change is  happening due to global temperature rise, it is urgent that the vulnerability of developing countries  to climate change is reduced and their capacity to adapt is increased and national adaptation  plans are implemented. Adapting to climate change will entail adjustments and changes at every  level from community to national and international. Communities must build their resilience,  including adopting appropriate technologies while making the most of traditional knowledge,  and diversifying their livelihoods to cope with current and future climate stress. Local coping  strategies and knowledge need to be used in synergy with government and local interventions.  The need of adaptation interventions depends on national circumstances. There is a large body of  knowledge and experience within local communities on coping with climatic variability and extreme  weather events. Local communities have always aimed to adapt to variations in their climate. To  do so, they have made preparations based on their resources and their knowledge accumulated  through experience of past weather patterns. This includes times when they have also been forced  to react to and recover from extreme events, such as floods, drought and hurricanes. Local coping  strategies are an important element of planning for adaptation. Climate change is leading  communities to experience climatic extremes more frequently, as well as new climate conditions  and extremes. Traditional knowledge can help to provide efficient, appropriate and time - tested  ways of advising and enabling adaptation to climate change in communities who are feeling the  effects of climate changes due to global warming        Given below are the factors of vulnerability of poor people to climate change.
